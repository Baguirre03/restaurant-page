### About the project

For this project I was tasked with the change to practice DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a restaurant homepage! I was enabled to only use JavaScript to generate the entire contents of the website by using Webpack and Modules for separation and functionality of each pages!

### Objectives

- [x] Successfully setup webpack for the project
- [x] Create a homepage and other Modules which will be used and ran in an index.js file
- [x] Import JavaScript into Dist/
- [x] Create basic design and mobile responsiveness
- [x] Upload to git-hub pages using only the Dist directory

### What I learned and What I would do differently

- Learned how to setup webpack, this enabled me to create a skeleton Webpack directory in which I can use for future projects.
- Setting up webpack took a while to understand but with this project I was able to get a better understanding of what webpack is _actually_ doing and have a deeper knowledge on it's syntax
- This project was the first time using modules, with that being said the approach took a little bit of learning but I understand the functionality of it much more!
- With that, my BasicFunctions.js had a little **too** many functions in it. If I could go back I would create one or two, and have those be able to dynamically change which element is being created.
- I also learned how to add CSS and images with webpack rather than just JS. With some speedbumps I was able to get the project fully stylized with a simple green color scheme which I am pretty proud of!
